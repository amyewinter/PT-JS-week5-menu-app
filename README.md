JS Week 5 coding assignment - a simple menu application

This is a simple menu application that allows archivists 
to add collections and create items within the collections  
with a title, creator, and year.  They can then list collections, 
the items within a collection, and display the properties of items.
They can also delete items and collections.

I modified the example that was created in the course video because I 
wanted to use the describe() methods from the classes as a way to practice
providing more information to the user when actions were taken.

I also added delete confirmation options, for additional practice.
